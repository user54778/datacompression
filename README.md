# Data Compression

The purpose of this repository is for me to implement the concepts and solve select exercises as mentioned in the Fourth Edition of Introduction to Data Compression using Go as a form of self-study.

## Huffman

* Includes a bare-bones implementation of a Huffman Code.

### Golomb

* A basic Golomb encoder implementation. Needs the decoder.

### Tunstall

* A basic implementation of a Tunstall tree/code. Does not have the actual encoder or decoder.

## Arithmetic Coding

* Hard-coded implementation for a float-version arithmetic encoder/decoder.

* A proper 8-bit encoder. Decoder needs to be implemented. Considering making a proper Go project of this.

## Dictionary Coders

### Digram Coding

* A simple digram coder with a hard-coded dictionary.
